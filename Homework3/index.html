  <h1>Cosmetics Data</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        These three graphs are the data visualizations that I thought would convey the Cosmetics data set the best. For the overview of the data, I wanted to compare the average rank with the price each product for all 6 of the different labels (moisturizer, cleanser, treatment, face mask, eye cream, and sun protection), hence why I chose to do parallel set plot (an advanced visualization). I also wanted an overview of just the products that are used in this data set so I used a pie chart to compare the different labels that are present in this data set. Finally, for my context view, I created a bar graph to showcase my findings from comparing the average rank of products to the different prices. I will explain in more detail about my observations from all three of these graphs in the observation section. This will be a continuation from my HW 2 assignment as I have now included interactions or animated transitions to each of my visualizations. The interaction technique that I have used in my dashboard is the pan and zoom technique. As for the animation I chose to use, I implemented the view transition as well as the visualization change.

  <h2>Observations</h2>
  <p>First looking at the parallel plot, I am able to compare all the different products by label and see how prices affect the rank of the product. Overall, I can see that generally for any type of product in the $10-$155 price range has a rank of above a 3.0. As soon as a product is over $155, we can see fluctuations between the quality and the type of product labels. The interaction technique that I used in this visualization is the pan and zoom and also selection techniques. I chose to implement both of these interactions in this visualization because it is the most data heavy as I have the whole data set on a parallel plot. So, by having the pan and zoom, users can select a section of the graph that they want to observe in more detail and look at the section more closely. They are able to select a section and if they want to go even closer onto the data points, they can click on the boxed selection again. To get out of the zoomed in view, they just have to double tap outside the selected section. The animations used here is the view transition since my data visualization can change its viewpoint.  </p>
  <p>After observing this overview data visualization, I wanted to focus more on products that had higher than a 4.0 rank and so I focused the view on the price range of $60-$100 in the form of a bar chart. What my focus view on the bar chart showed me in detail was how even split all the 6 product labels were in terms of the ranking, so I can come to a conclusion that the best cosmetic products to get would be in this range. For this data visualization, I just added an animated transition of each of the bars moving into their values. By doing so, users can follow each of the values as it moves and compare them with the other bars more easily. 
  </p>
  <p>Finally, my other data visualization (pie chart) just showed me the overview of the products by the labels. I could see how many cosmetics were being tested in this data set with moisturizers having the most products and sun protects having the lest amount of products to review. Here, I used the hover technique so if the user hovers their mouse over a section of the bar graph, they are able to see the percentage each value has. Each piece also expands a little so visually, it is easier for the user to see the data and recognize which piece of the pie chart they are looking at.</p>
